## Front-end Developer in React.js || Javascript Developer

Hello Everyone,
My name is Ibrahim Gazi.I worked as a Front-end Developer. I just want to share my starting journey as a web developer. To tell the truth, I never imagined introducing myself as a web developer. Because I just wanted to make a website for my office to keep track of our remaining bills. But with time a love for coding started to develop. Then I am serious about web development. I am constantly striving to improve myself as a Web developer. Last 2 Years I have become familiar with all the technologies of this stock. But now, I feel I am ready to do work internationally. 

I think Coding is not easy to learn for everyone ( Personal Opinion ). It was more difficult for me because I was a job holder. It requires a lot of persistence, willingness, and time to learn. Since I love coding so much I might end up doing this. It has now merged with my soul. eat, sleep, code, and repeat.“I don’t stop when I’m tired; I stop when I’m done.”
